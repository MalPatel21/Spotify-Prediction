Proposal:
	The goal of the Spotify Prediction Project is to accurately predict the popularity of songs by using a myriad of musical features including danceability, popularity, tempo, tone, artist genres, etc. In order to accurately make these predictions the project will utilize the linear regression machine learning algorithm. 
           This project will leverage the “6k Spotify Playlist” Dataset from Kaggle. This set of data contains information that was generated by the company, Spotify. The information that is included in this dataset pertains to music- specifically details about artists, song tracks, release dates, and more. For this project, I will be using the audio features: energy, danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveliness, speechiness, and, loudness. From artists.csv I will be using artist_popularity, artist_genres, and artist_follow.  From final_playlists.csv: playlist_followers and n_tracks. From final_tracks: popularity, album_type, is_playable, release_date, artists_uris, playlist_uris. All of these attributes will be used to predict our target variable- track_popularity using Linear Regression.
